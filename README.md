Constantly updated cs2 offsets (faster than a2x)
Completely automated and i might release the dumper soon!
### Goals
- 5 stars: release binary of the dumper
- 10 stars: give the server binary (flask binary)
- 15 stars: auto offset searcher (it gives updated offsets based on the ones you gave it)
- 20 stars: release source of everything
